(the &ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c6">Application</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;). &nbsp;We are excited to bring you the Application, an innovative platform that permits you to select and transmit a request for services to professional medical practices, including Heal, Heal At-Home Medical and Heal Seniors (each, a &ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c6">Medical Practice</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;) that provide non-emergency general adult and pediatric healthcare services in the comfort and convenience of a patient&rsquo;s home, office, or workplace (&ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c6">House Calls</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;).</span><span class="c7 c6">&nbsp; </span><span class="c0">Heal is a technology information service provider that owns the Application, which is &nbsp;licensed to the Medical Practices, and does not refer or recommend any Physician or Medical Practice. &nbsp;Rather, the Application is a platform that allows you to transmit a request for a House Call to a Medical Practice, and provides the capability for the Medical Practice to respond and schedule a House Call for you. &nbsp;Upon a request for a House Call from a Medical Practice, at your direction, the Application will transmit your request to the Medical Practice that you select, including your location, which will be used to determine whether the Medical Practice provides services in your area. &nbsp;Upon providing certain relevant information to a Medical Practice through the Application, if a physician licensed to practice medicine in the applicable jurisdiction working with the Medical Practice (&ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c6">Physician</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;) and a medical assistant working with the Medical Practice (&ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c6">Medical Assistant</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;) are available, the Medical Practice will then choose whether or not to dispatch a physician to your location; provided, however, that the Physician may, in his or her best judgment, based on information received prior to the House Call or during the House Call, determine that he or she is unable to provide treatment. &nbsp;The Physicians and Medical Assistants are sometimes referred to herein as &ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c6">Health Care Professionals.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">If you are using the Application to request a House Call for a minor, you must be available during the Physician&rsquo;s visit with the minor, or have provided authorization for a third party in whose care the minor is entrusted to consent to medical care of the minor (subject to applicable laws). &nbsp;You are responsible for payment for the Services provided the minor, and you are assuming the obligations of this Agreement as they relate to the minor.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Services shall be subject to this Agreement. &nbsp;You are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Application.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">The Medical Practices that license the Application currently charge on a fee-for-service basis in connection with providing a House Call (&ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c6">Fee</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;). &nbsp;If you are a member of an insurance plan that contracts with a Medical Practice as an in-network provider, and your insurance coverage has previously been verified by Heal; the Medical Practice will bill your insurance plan for the portion of the Fee for which it is responsible. You will still be responsible for any applicable copayments or deductibles, and your credit card will be charged accordingly. &nbsp;Heal makes no guarantee that a House Call that you schedule with a Medical Practice will be covered by your health insurance. &nbsp;In addition, not all Medical Practices are contracted with all health plans or enrolled with Medicare or Medicaid. &nbsp;Ultimately, it is your responsibility to determine how your health insurance benefits apply to services provided by the Medical Practices. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c1">In order to obtain our Services you must provide us with certain personal information and register for an account. &nbsp;We respect your privacy and a complete statement of our current privacy policy can be found here (&ldquo;</span><span class="c6">Privacy Policy</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;) </span><span class="c1 c31"><a href="https://heal.com/privacy.php">https://heal.com/privacy.php</a></span><span class="c0">.

<p>Burrito Labs, Inc. D/B/A Heal, and its predecessors, successors, licensors, beneficiaries and/or affiliates (collectively, “Heal” or “we”) welcome you to download our proprietary mobile application software called “Heal™” (or the “Application”).  By downloading and using the Application, and by receiving services through the Application and/or via our Website (if applicable) (“Services”), you agree to be bound by the terms of service set out below (the “Agreement”).</p>
 <p>If you do not agree to all of the terms of this Agreement, do not use the Application or our Services.  Heal may revise and update this Agreement at any time.  Your continued use of the Application or our Services will mean you accept the revised Agreement.  All references to the “Application” in this Agreement shall be construed to also include our Website (if applicable).</p>
<ol>
<li><h2>Our Services; Registration and Membership.</h2>

<p>Congratulations on your decision to download Heal™.  We are excited to bring you an innovative platform that provides you with health information, including information regarding an independent professional medical practice (“Medical Practice”), which may be available to provide physicians at your door and on-demand in under an hour.  Heal is a technology information service provider that provides patients with health information and provides a forum for an independent Medical Practice that provides non-emergency general adult and pediatric healthcare services in the comfort and convenience of a patient’s home, office, or workplace to promote the unique services it offers (“House Calls”).  Upon request for a House Call, the Application will automatically transmit your location which will be used to determine whether the Medical Practice provides services in your area.  Upon providing certain relevant information to the Medical Practice through the Application, if a physician licensed to practice medicine in California working with the independent Medical Practice (“Physician”) and a medical assistant working with the independent Medical Practice (“Medical Assistant”) are available, the Physician and Medical Assistant will then choose whether or not to be dispatched to your location; provided, however, that the Physician may, in his or her best judgment, based on information received prior to the House Call or during the House Call, determine that he or she is unable to provide treatment.  The Physicians and Medical Assistants are sometimes referred to herein as “Health Care Professionals”.</p>

<p>If you are using the Application for Services to a minor, you must be available during the Physician’s visit with the minor, you are responsible for payment for the Services provided the minor, and are assuming the obligations of this Agreement as they relate to the minor.</p>

<p>Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Services shall be subject to the Agreement.  You are responsible for all equipment necessary to access Heal.</p>

<p>The Medical Practice that is featured on the Application currently charges on a fee-for-service basis in connection with providing a house-call Physician and Medical Assistant (“Service Fee”), which the Health Care Professionals will collect directly from you at the time of a House Call.</p>
<p>In order to obtain our Services you must provide us with certain personal information and create a membership account (“Membership”).  We respect your privacy and a complete statement of our current privacy policy can be found here (“Privacy Policy”).  Our Privacy Policy is expressly incorporated into this Agreement by this reference.</p>
<p>The independent Medical Practice may provide promotional advertising on our Application.  If you choose to click on such promotional advertising, you will then be connected to a portion of the Application controlled by such Medical Practice and will be able to communicate with such Medical Practice.</p>
</li>
<li><h2>You Must Provide Accurate Information to Maintain Your Membership.</h2>

<p>The Medical Practice featured on Heal and Heal do not take payment from any third party, including any insurance company, PPO, HMO, medigap,  employer group health plan, or any state or federal governmental health plan such as Medicare or Medicaid.  They also do not allow use of any credit, flex or debit card connected to your employer’s group health plan, cafeteria plan, flex plan, 125 plan or self-insured group health plan.  By clicking to accept this agreement you verify that  your credit card is not connected to your employer’s group health plan, cafeteria plan, flex plan, 125 plan or any or any health insurance, PPO, HMO, medigap policy, or any governmental health plan such as Medicare or Medicaid.  It is imperative that you provide accurate and truthful information about your identity and your health and physical condition during the registration process.  By filling in the Membership information requested you represent and warrant to Heal that all of the personal information you provide during this process is true and correct.  Heal reserves the right to refuse or cancel your Membership or your use of the Application and/or the Services if Heal determines that you have not provided complete and accurate information regarding your identity and/or have not provided accurate health information.</p>

<p>You also agree that you will not choose or use a user name that: (i) belongs to another person or is used with the intent of impersonating another person; or (ii) is subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization.  You may never use another person’s Membership or log in details to access the Application and/or Services.</p>


</li>
<li><h2>Eligibility.</h2>

<p>You must reside in California  and be 18 years of age or older to use the Application and the Services provided through the Application.  You understand that there may be no Medical Practice or Health Care Professionals in your area and we cannot guarantee that Health Care Professionals will be available to provide Services in your area.  If you are requesting pediatric Services for a minor, you must verify that you are the parent, guardian or other adult responsible for the minor.  By using the Application and our Services you represent that you are at least 18 years of age or are the parent, guardian or other adult responsible for a minor.</p>

<p>You must notify us immediately of any change in your eligibility to use the Services including any changes to your medical condition or physical fitness, breach of security or unauthorized use of your Membership with Heal.</p>
</li>

<li><h2>Our Services.</h2>
<p>Heal is a technology information service provider that provides patients with health information and provides a forum for an independent Medical Practice that provides non-emergency general adult and pediatric healthcare services in the comfort and convenience of a patient’s home, office, or workplace, allowing the Physicians to diagnose and deliver medical treatments in-person to adults or children.
The Medical Practice promoting itself on Heal must perform thorough background checks on Physicians to ensure that they are in current good standing with the California medical board, as well as thorough background checks on any Medical Assistants accompanying the Physicians during the House Calls.</p>
<p>The Medical Practice that promotes itself on Heal, and its Health Care Professionals, are not employees of Heal.  Employees of Heal do not provide users health care services and take no part in your medical diagnosis and/or treatment.  Heal shall not be liable for any professional advice from a health care professional that is provided to a user in-person or via telephone, nor for any information obtained on our Application.  We do not recommend or endorse any specific tests, health care or service providers, medications, products or procedures.  You acknowledge that your reliance on any health care providers that promote themselves on our Application or information provided by such health care providers to you is solely at your own risk and you assume full responsibility for all risk associated therewith, as allowable by the extent of the law.</p>
<p>Consult with your regular licensed health care provider as necessary and before seeking any new treatment or before you alter, suspend or initiate any change in your medical treatment, medication routine or health care related procedure or activity.  Do not disregard medical advice issued to you by your regular licensed healthcare provider.</p>
<p>You will be required to enter into separate agreements with the Medical Practice providing you with medical services (“Physician Agreements”).  Physician Agreements include, but are not limited to arbitration agreements, privacy policies, medical services consents, and nondisclosure agreements.  The Medical Practice that promotes itself on Heal, and its Health Care Professionals, are independent of Heal, and Heal is not responsible for any issues you may have with respect to the Medical Practice’s or a Health Care Professional’s professionalism, timeliness, medical treatment, diagnosis or advice, information provided, or any other actions or omissions arising from, or incident to, any services provided by the Medical Practice or Health Care Professionals.</p>
</li>

<li><h2>IMPORTANT HEALTH AND MEDICAL NOTICES AND DISCLAIMERS.</h2>

<p>IF YOU CHOOSE TO BE CONNECTED WITH THE MEDICAL PRACTICE, AN ELECTRONIC SERVICE REQUEST NOTIFICATION WILL BE SENT TO THE MEDICAL PRACTICE.  IF THE MEDICAL PRACTICE HAS AN AVAILABLE PHYSICIAN, AN IN-PERSON MEETING BETWEEN YOU AND A LICENSED PHYSICIAN, AT A LOCATION OF YOUR CHOOSING MAY OCCUR.  WITH RESPECT TO THE PROVISION OF HOUSE CALLS, THE APPLICATION IS EXCLUSIVELY FOR ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT AND TO PROVIDE YOU WITH INFORMATION REGARDING A MEDICAL PRACTICE THAT PROVIDES SERVICE IN YOUR AREA.  NO MEDICAL CARE OR ADVICE SHALL BE PROVIDED DIRECTLY TO YOU FROM OUR APPLICATIONS.  A REPORT OF YOUR SYMPTOMS WILL BE CONVEYED TO THE MEDICAL PRACTICE AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS.</p>

<p>BY USING THE APPLICATION OR OUR SERVICES YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT Heal IS NOT A MEDICAL ORGANIZATION, HOSPITAL OR STAFFED BY MEDICALLY TRAINED PERSONNEL.</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT Heal’ EMPLOYEES CANNOT PROVIDE YOU WITH MEDICAL ADVICE AND NOTHING THAT YOU MAY READ IN OR THROUGH THE USE OF THIS APPLICATION OR OUR SERVICES SHOULD BE CONSTRUED AS MEDICAL ADVICE.  ALTHOUGH THE  MEDICAL PRACTICE AND ITS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND EMPLOYEES MAKE AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE QUALITY INFORMATION TO YOU, Heal EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED GUARANTEE OR WARRANTY REGARDING THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS, OR RELEVANCE OF ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE APPLICATION, OR THE SERVICES OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS SENT TO YOU OR ANY MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY THROUGH THE APPLICATION.</p>
</li>

<li><h2>Geo-Location Functionality.</h2>

<p>The Services include and make use of certain functionality and services provided by third parties that allow Heal to include maps, geocoding, places and other content from Google, Inc. (“Google”) as part of the Services (the “Geo-Location Services”).  Your use of the Geo-Location Services is subject to Google’s then current Terms of Use for Google Maps/Google Earth (<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/help/terms_maps.html">http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/help/terms_maps.html</a>) and by using the Geo-Location Services, you are agreeing to be bound by Google’s Terms of Use.</p>
</li>


<li>
<h2>Additional Services and Terms.</h2>

<p>Some of the Services we offer may be subject to additional terms and conditions.  Your use of such Services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which will be provided to you before the affected Services are provided.  Any such additional terms and conditions are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.</p>
</li>

<li><h2>Membership Charges; Credit Card Billing and Additional Purchases.</h2>

<p>The “Beta” version of the Application is free of charge.  However, in the future there may be charges for certain Heal Services.  At the time we launch Heal and our Services, all billing (if applicable) will be handled by Apple® or Google® (depending upon which service you use and which version of the application you download).  In the future we may ask for payment information from you directly and you will have the option to continue with Services or decline them at that time.</p>
<p>Through the Services, you may also be able to purchase certain goods or additional features or other services designed to enhance the performance of the Application or the Services (“In App Purchase”).  When you make an In App Purchase, you are doing so through Apple iTunes service and you are agreeing to Apple’s iTunes’ Terms and Conditions.  Alternatively, depending on your operating system, you may be purchasing through the Google® Play service, and by doing so, you are agreeing to Google Play Terms and Conditions for purchases within an application.</p>
<p>During your use of the Application and our Services, you also may occasionally be offered incentives or merchandise either directly from Heal or from third parties that are not In App Purchases.  Those purchases, if you agree to them, may require you to provide credit card or other transaction data to us or to third party providers in order to procure such items.  We will only collect those details, if ever, for the sole purpose of fulfilling an order for products or services that you request.  Heal may retain your credit card details in an encrypted file, however.</p>
</li>

<li><h2>Cancellations.</h2>

<p>If you choose to cancel your Membership or your Services, all you have to do is email support@heal.com.  We will refund any fees you have paid for unused Services.  Heal reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to reject users of its Services and Application.  If we reject you after you have paid a subscription fee, Heal will reimburse the unused portion of that fee.</p>
</li>


<li><h2>Term, Renewal, and Expiration.</h2>

<p>Your Membership will renew automatically for consecutive periods of the same duration as the Membership term originally selected, unless we terminate it or you notify us by email at support@heal.com and/or through our system (receipt of which must be confirmed by email reply from us) of your decision to terminate your subscription.  You must cancel your Membership before it renews in order to avoid billing of any applicable subscription fees charged through Apple or Google.  Subject to the foregoing, ANY CREDITS WHICH REMAIN OUTSTANDING AND UNUSED FOR A PERIOD OF MORE THAN ONE (1) CALENDAR YEAR FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE SHALL BE SUBJECT TO EXPIRATION AND TERMINATION BY Heal, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, AND NO REFUND OR OTHER COMPENSATION WILL BE GIVEN TO YOU IF SUCH EXPIRATION AND TERMINATION OCCURS.</p>
</li>

<li><h2>Account Security.</h2>

<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password that you designate during the Membership registration process and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your username and password.  You shall immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your username or password or any other breach of security.  Heal will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision.  You should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer or using unencrypted email to discuss private matters with any Physician or Medical Practice, so that others are not able to view, record or intercept your password or other personal information.  You have been informed of the risks of transmitting your personal information by an unsecured means.</p>

<p>Once it is received, your personal information and that of any minor for whom you are responsible is kept secure by Heal, the Medical Practice, and the Health Care Professionals, in accordance with applicable law.</p>
</li>
