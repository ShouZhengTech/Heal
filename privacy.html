When you request a Visit, you will need to provide us with health-related information that a Physician will need to determine whether he/she is willing to provide medical services to you. &nbsp;We will not use any PHI for any other purpose without your written authorization, or unless otherwise permitted or required by law. &nbsp;You may revoke, in writing, any such authorization at any time, except to the extent we have taken action in reliance thereon. &nbsp;Heal will not have any independent access to a Medical Practice&rsquo;s detailed health record, if any, created as a result of a Visit. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c3 c4">WE DO NOT KNOWINGLY ENROLL OR COLLECT INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3 c4">Please keep in mind that certain features on the Application or website may give you an opportunity to interact with us and others. These may include forums, message boards, chats, creating community profiles, and rating, tagging and commenting on articles. When you use these features you should be aware that any information you submit, including your name, location, health issues, and email address, may be publicly available to others. We do not protect the privacy of and are not responsible for your disclosure of any information through these interactive features, including, but not limited to information that you might post related to a minor. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3 c4">Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose anyone&rsquo;s personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information that you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to information you choose to disclose through these interactive features. When an individual chooses to post information that will be publicly disclosed, he or she is responsible for all legal consequences.

These services may record unique mobile gestures such as tap, double-tap, zoom, pinch, scroll, swipe and tilt but do not collect personally identifiable information that you do not voluntarily enter in the Application. These services do not track your browsing habits across mobile applications that do not use the same services.

We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information that is not health information or medical information in the form of statistics and information regarding the Application user&rsquo;s statistics and metrics obtained from third party devices (for example, steps, distance, calories burned, GPS coordinates, bat speed, hand speed, swing time, etc.), which may be combined with personal information you submit through the Application and/or Services so that you can fully enjoy the benefits of the Application&rsquo;s tracking, monitoring, and diagnostic tools. &nbsp;We may also request the following optional information as part of your profile so that you can fully enjoy the features and functions of our Services: your weight, height, and gender. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c6 c19"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">Mobile Device Information</span><span class="c3 c4">. Your use of the Application may also include collection of information from your mobile device. &nbsp;For example, the Application may request your permission to collect location data and/or may request access to multimedia (photos or videos) stored on your mobile device. &nbsp;You have the option of declining collection of geolocation data, but this may limit your ability to participate in certain activities through the Application. &nbsp;If you do not wish for your location data to be shared with Heal, please respond accordingly when prompted on your mobile device, or visit your mobile device settings. &nbsp;Multimedia will only be collected from your device if you affirmatively select it to upload to the application (i.e. you choose an image or video to store within the Application). &nbsp;Multimedia will not be shared with other Application users (with the exception of your profile photo, to the extent such feature is offered, which will appear in your user profile).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><ol class="c5 lst-kix_list_3-0" start="3"><li class="c9"><span class="c7 c2 c0">How We Use Your Information</span><span class="c7 c4 c0">.</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;</span></li></ol><p class="c11"><span class="c3 c4"><br>Subject to this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Service, and applicable terms and conditions of third-party applications, all data transmitted through the Application or website is owned by Heal; provided, however, that PHI that you provide for the purpose of scheduling a Visit with a Medical Practice will be solely owned by the Medical Practice. &nbsp;To the extent &nbsp;Heal is precluded from owning data transmitted through the Application, you grant Heal a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free &nbsp;license to use such data (with the exception of PHI) to the extent necessary to enable use of the Application, the website, and Services.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. &nbsp;No method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, however. &nbsp;Therefore, while we strive to make all reasonable efforts to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. &nbsp;In the unlikely event of a data breach, you will be notified as soon as reasonably possible, in accordance with applicable law. &nbsp;Furthermore, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that receive the information. </span></p><p class="c6 c19"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Certain of the administrative, technical, and physical measures in place are as follows. &nbsp;Heal&rsquo;s infrastructure is kept in a secured data center that protects from unauthorized access to the physical servers, backups and any element used to store and/or process personal data. Only authorized personnel can access the data center. &nbsp;Heal systems and databases are backed up regularly to help protect the data in case of an incontrollable catastrophe. The data center that stores Heal servers has policies and procedures in place designed to safeguard the equipment that our data is stored on. &nbsp;Heal regularly upgrades its system software to include the latest security features. &nbsp;Heal servers are protected by a firewall system, which is designed to keep unwanted traffic or access out of our computer network. &nbsp;Heal also employs an intrusion prevention service (IPS) provided by a secured data center operated by a professional company, and uses security methods to determine the identity of each registered user, so that appropriate rights and restrictions can be enforced for that user. Reliable verification of user identity is called &quot;authentication.&quot;&nbsp;All communication between Heal&rsquo;s Web server, your browser and the Application is encrypted with SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to guard against network eavesdroppers. Your password is internally encrypted in Heal&rsquo;s system to prevent unauthorized access to the system. Validations are built throughout the application to capture the most reliable information. Only the last 4 digits of your credit card number is stored on our servers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><ol class="c5 lst-kix_list_3-0" start="8"><li class="c9"><span class="c7 c2 c0">Changes To Our Privacy Policy</span><span class="c7 c4 c0">.</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;</span></li></ol><p class="c13"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">From time to time we may revise this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your information, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the end of the Privacy Policy.
